### What?
LameUI is a super simple, platform independent UI library with lots of limitations, designed for embedded systems with low resources. It's under active development and I'm trying to add more features. Two important goals of LameUI are:
 - Be lightweight
 - Use minimum number of files

### Why?
Main reason - to challenge my skills and learn new things. It was started as a pastime project during the first covid-19 lock-down and soon enough I abandoned it in an incomplete state as I lost interest. After 4 months I came back to it with a goal to at least make it work once. Future of this project is uncertain, but as long as it feels challenging, I'll keep adding/fixing stuffs.

### Who?
**Who will use it?**  
Probably no one. Unless you need a very simple and very lightweight UI library.

**Who is/are developing it?**  
I, alone.
